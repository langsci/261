\section{Introduction}\label{s:eb1} 

The idea of “interpersonal relations” is used in this paper to refer to a language-focused developmental process involving emergent patterns of communication and understanding in the interaction of distinctively different people within a community. It was probably used anthropologically by the modernist Edward \citeauthor{Sapir1932} (\citeyear{Sapir1932}; \citealt{Basso1998}).  Sapir repeatedly noted in his lectures at Yale that the interaction of people of different personalities and their influence on the thought and action of a community has consequences with many historical implications (\citealt[204]{Sapir1993}). When people respond to one another during conversational interaction as they receive information about the worlds of others, Sapir noted, they participate in contexts wherein  judgments or evaluations of propositions are being made, often while speakers are trying to make decisions and plans for future action.  More recently,   John \citeauthor{DuBois2004}’ technical use of “alignment” refers to such ongoing activity   ‘in which two participants in dialogical interaction ...converse in varying degrees’  in taking a stance (\citeyear[22--23]{DuBois2004}).  Evidential and epistemic markers contribute to a speaker’s evaluation, self-positioning, and alignments with other subjects concerning the sharing of knowledge and evaluation of the epistemic object or proposition. (\citealt[24]{DuBois2007}).  Such stance enactments are central to the pragmatic functioning  of sociality and everyday power (\citealt[5--6]{Ameka2004}).   
%\isi{finality}

In this paper I discuss stance enactments as they occur among speakers of Kalapalo,  a Southern Cariban agglutinative language currently spoken by about 630 people in the Alto Xingu region of central Brazil (\citealt{Guerreiro2015}). In Kalapalo, a large number of epistemic markers are central to the pragmatic functioning of social life.  My interest in this  epistemic marking has grown out of my earlier anthropological work on Kalapalo narrative discourse (\textit{akiñatunda}) , a dialogical practice structured in large measure by the interaction between a narrator (\textit{akiña otoi})  and a ‘listener-responder’ (\textit{etuitsofo}) (\citealt{Basso1985}; \citeyear{Basso1986}; \citeyear{Basso1987}; \citeyear{Basso1995}). Analyses of recorded narrated speech events assisted my understanding of the use of the epistemic features.  In this material, dialogicality exists in the many narrated quoted conversations in which occur emergent processes of challenge, resistance, debate, deception, and the negotiation of meaning.  Emotional events such as respect and endearment, as well as anger, shame, lust, greed, and envy are important for descriptions of protagonists  and it is through their quoted speech that we can see how these emerge from social interaction (\citealt{Basso2007}).  A narrator’s authority to speak of imaginary or historical subjects is an adventure in language, a kind of critical social commentary that may not be tolerated in other public situations.  Presentation of sociohistorical and mythological realities include fantasies regarding human bodily processes and  tricksters’ appetite for subversion,  as well as historical memories of women who have been abducted and who learned to live in a different kind of society,  and the personal adventures of warriors and shamans.  The materials presented here include quoted conversations (often, interspersed with narrators’ commentary), as well as from my own conversations with Kalapalo, and from the ritual speech of hereditary leaders (\citealt{Basso2009}; see also \citealt{Franchetto1983}, \citeyear{Franchetto2000}).
 
In Kalapalo there is a set of six hearsay evidential markers (EV) mainly used in narrative and in quoted discourse (Table \ref{tab:eb1});  %TODO EV and EXP?
eight initial position epistemic expressives (EXP) which directly mark first person judgment  and sometimes 1$^{st}$ person evidence (Table \ref{tab:eb2})\footnote{Another set of expressives are affective (marking fear, pain, sensory pleasure, disgust, grief, frustration). Their use by Kalapalo speakers tends to create a synergy of sentiment with listeners. The epistemic expressives are both interpersonal as well as cognitive and introspective in semantic function as shown in Table \ref{tab:eb2}. Both sub-sets of the expressive word class are in the main used by speakers to introduce further descriptive commentary.}
and the  large set (28) %TODO what does that number refer to?
of second position epistemic clitics or free particles (EM) that I have ordered into six pragmatic sets; EM numbers correspond to the full set listed in the Appendix\footnote{Due to the large number of EM markers and complex semantic features, some of which (e.g., assertion, inferential, negation) may be repeated in the use of several forms, I have used numbers rather than semantically informative glosses. Full descriptions occur in the examples and the Appendix.}.

Kalapalo epistemic markers appear at the end of an adverbial phrase, a nominal phrase or clause, or a converbal or lexical verbal clause. There is rarely any vowel reduction; excepting with the morpheme \textit{aka}, and no epistemic clitic are vowel initial.  The morpheme \textit{muk$^w$e} may show elision when followed by a vowel initial phonological word.  Nonetheless, most epistemic morphemes function as clitics insofar as they are phonologically bound through (second syllable) stress patterning to their host constructions, thereby playing a key role in phonological word construction.  Epistemic markers have the ability to be compounded with one another, and with other types of clitics (\citealt{Basso2014}), as seen in examples \ref{ex:eb6}, \ref{ex:eb35b}, \ref{ex:eb37}, \ref{ex:eb41a},  \ref{ex:eb52}, \ref{ex:eb63c}.\footnote{Similar morphemes have been described in the pioneering work on Northern Cariban languages  by  B.J. \cite{Hoff1986}, Eithne \cite{Carlin2004}; and  Sergio \cite{Meira1999}.  Northern  Cariban epistemic clitics usually appear after the first element in a clause (Wackernagel’s position); the scope of the clitic including the entire clause (\citealt{Hoff1986}).}
 
 
A number of the Kalapalo parameters seem to closely match those specified by B.J. \cite{Hoff1986} for Surinam Carib (Kari’na) and also Bruna \citeauthor{Franchetto}’ s (n.d.) discussion of  (so-called modal) ‘marker’s of true speech’ in the closely related Alto Xingu Kuikuro language.  However, with one exception, I use different language to describe these features in keeping with my emphasis on person-person deixis and dialogicality in stance processes.  What \citeauthor{Hoff1986} calls “grade” (strong-weak-lacking); “speaker’s attitude”, “appeals on speaker”, “change of grade” and “co-existence with supporting or conflicting evidence” are clearly semantic parameters found in Kalapalo epistemic marking.  \citeauthor{Hoff1986}’s specification of an underlying contrast in the Surinam Carib particle set between the origins of “extraspective” and  “introspective” evidence  is also an evidential feature in Kalapalo, an this can be understood with reference to Ferdinand \citeauthor{Haan2001}’s (\citeyear{Haan2001}) approach that allows for a pragmatic description subsuming evidential and epistemic features.  \citeauthor{Haan2001} distinguishes between two deictic categories relevant to evidentiality: in the first, the speaker is separated (or separates themselves) from the action being described; in the second, the speaker includes themself in the description of the action.
 In fact, these make sense for Kalapalo epistemic marking, when the stance object is foregrounded in the discourse segment  (particularly in Sets A and B). 
But there is also the third person marked both as a logophoric interlocutor and as an epistemic object.  There are four epistemic markers which can be used to describe logophoricity of several kinds: \textbf{\textit{kafa}} Em17, weak but positive; \textbf{\textit{kato}} Em18, troublesome ; \textbf{\textit{nafa}} Em20, an animate but non-human response; \textbf{\textit{kalaka}} Em23, reflexive desire.  Alignment (or ‘engagement’) is yet another deictic field,   involving a speaker referencing an other subject’s inclusion in the sphere of epistemic stance (as in Sets E and F). 
These involve participant frameworks relevant to Kalapalo epistemic markers in which the intersubjective relation is foregrounded and the object-subject relation recedes (though it is not entirely absent from discursive commentary). 

While epistemic modality in the sense of a “scale” or “grade” is a feature of Kalapalo epistemology, there are important non-modal features that emerge as speakers evaluate information, including a) participation (or not)  of the speaker and listener and a third person in a cooperative epistemic context, b) changes or correctives due to receipt of new information; c) mirativity (due to new and surprising information) and incredulity (an extreme skepticism or unwillingness to believe); d) counter-factive or contra-spective wishing or hoping, and e) acceptance or rejection of a conjoint project.  I show in examples how the four logophoric markers mark responses to different kinds of experiences, speech, or desires and plans of someone other than the interlocutors:  
Although I follow earlier writers (\citealt{Aikhenvald2004}, \citealt{Haan1999}, \citeyear{Haan2001}; \citealt{NuckollsLev2012}), in making a distinction between evidentiality (EV) and epistemic markers (EM) as shown in the preceding tables,   Kalapalo EV, EXP and EM are often combined in discourse as many of the examples will show; and some EM also mark types of evidentiality (first hand experience; inference (or lack of direct speech evidence) regarding a second or third person’s thoughts and plans); these are not seen in the EV set.  Past tense semantics occurs with the use of \textbf{\textit{wãke}} EM1 and \textbf{\textit{nipa}} EM 24, of interest as there is no past tense marking on the verb.  In addition four EM (\textbf{\textit{kiŋi}}, plural \textbf{\textit{kiŋi-ni}} EM11, \textbf{\textit{pile}} EM15, tiki EM19,  \textbf{\textit{tima}} EM28)  have negation meanings.  What follows is a brief listing of the six epistemic sets sorted according to pragmatic and semantic features. These sets are discussed further with examples in Sections \ref{s:eb2}-\ref{s:eb4}, followed by my final observations in section \ref{s:eb5}.  Names of original narrators and location of my research recordings are given following the examples.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sets A-D mark a focus upon the speaker’s evaluation of a proposition and ‘positioning’%4 %TODO FN4?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set A: knowledge has been received internally; the speaker is a participant in the propositional context. 
		\item Set B: knowledge is received externally; the speaker is not a participant in the propositional context but must infer or deduce from this external evidence.     
	\end{itemize}    
	\item Sets C and D: involve subjective ‘positioning’ used after a speaker has received new information
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set C involves self-correctives 
		\item Set D  concerns counter-factive or contra-spective acknowledgment,  wishing or hoping’
	\end{itemize}
	\item Sets E and F concern the speaker’s marking of epistemic alignment, that is, participation in a shared or in two cases, disputed propositional context. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Set E marks shared information; one negative marks refusal to share information
		\item Set F marks speaker’s proposal or rejection of a conjoint project. In this set there is a marker with negative meaning used when the speaker refuses to participate or to be blamed in such a context.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Internal versus extenal contrasts in Sets A and B}\label{s:eb2}

Sets A and B are similar to Berend \citeauthor{Hoff1986}’s (\citeyear{Hoff1986}) specification of an underlying contrast in the Northern Cariban Kari’na (or Surinam Carib) particle set between the origins of two types of evidence.  The first is “introspective”, “inner world of the speaker”; evidence in the mind of the speaker; private knowledge.  The second is ‘extraspective’ evidence from the “outside world”, that is, evidence external to the speaker’s experiences; or public knowledge. 

\subsection{Set A}   

Knowledge is ‘internal’, part of the speaker’s experience. There are six members of this set.  These markers seem to reference an interloctor’s thoughts or ideas, rather than direct speech so contrastwith the hearsay EV group.

\subsubsection{\textit{wãke} EM1} 
With this frequently used marker, the speaker asserts a (usually distant) past experience in which knowledge or evidence has been acquired. The strong assertion is often seen in the speaker’s repetition of the marker after each clause.  In the example, upon hearing that his friend is the lone survivor of a massacre, the speaker declares that was why he didn’t join them earlier, expecting to have to avenge them all.

\end{exe}

\subsubsection{\textit{tifa} EM2}
This marks affirmation of the interlocutor’s current understanding of  (or thoughts about )  the speaker’s recently spoken ideas. This marker may be based on the hearsay EV \textbf{\textit{ti}-}.  See example (\ref{ex:eb41a}) where EM2 contributes to the interlocutors belief that what he is saying is true.   Most examples apear to be referencing a 2$^{nd}$ or 3$^{rd}$ person’s thoughts rather than speech. 
%a.
The following example marks an exclusive plural person’s acceptance. 


\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb2}
	\gll tis-eti-dyi-pïgï-iña=\textbf{tifa} ti-ŋifa-nïgï.\\
	1+3-come.out-ITR-VPE-BEN=\textbf{EM2} 1+3-teach-PS\\
	\trans ‘\textbf{You are right} to think that on behalf of our offspring (i.e., ‘those who come out of us’), is what we teach.' (said by Kudyu at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}

%b. 
Here, the speaker uses both EM2 in the nominalization part of the construction and  \textbf{\textit{taka}} EM22 \emph{agreement with someone else’s description of their experience} in the bracketed adverbial clause;  EM22 references his mother’s just-stated dismay at seeing his reddened eyes; the EM2 \textbf{\textit{tifa}} references the speaker’s acknowledgment of what she thought of the events being described. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb3}
	\gll (afïtï=\textbf{taka} igei-ufuŋu) ta-ŋo-fïŋï-\textbf{tifa}... tisuge, afïtï\\

	\trans ‘No, (=\textbf{because of what you saw}) you must know there’s got to be another kind of place where we can live, no.' (said by Kudyu at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}

%c.
Here the speaker confirms a 2p.’s understanding of a past event.  \textbf{\textit{wãke}} EM1 is used to assert the speaker’s own participation. Because of the group context,  I have used a first person plural translation. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb4}
	\gll ule-tse-ngugi=\textbf{tifa}=\textbf{wãke}, ngikogo e-nïgï \textbf{wãke}. aifu-pe-fa.\\

	\trans ‘\textbf{We saw} he was interrupted \textbf{just as you thought he would be} when he started things, \textbf{we saw} the fierce people come. It was all over for him.’
\end{exe}

%(3) 
\subsubsection{\textit{laka} EM3} 
This marks the speaker’s  very weak inference, puzzlement, or a strong inability to understand the participatory context. 
%a.  
This example includes both EM3 and the EXP \textbf{\textit{uum}}, \emph{referencing thought of an imaginative or inferential nature}. In \citeauthor{Haan2001}’s deictic model (\citeyear{Haan2001}), the speaker has put himself into the sphere of action.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb5}
	\gll \textbf{u:um} aŋi=\textbf{laka} ukuge ele-i ukuge\\
	\textbf{EXP} result=\textbf{EM3} {human being} DEM-COP {human being}\\
	\trans ‘I suppose that could have been human, a human being’. (said by Tufule at Aifa, 1982)
\end{exe}

%b. 
In a trickster story,  the speaker is surprised that he has already been told not to eat some fish parts, although he has already done so. The marker \textit{seku} following the verb \textit{te}-,’ eat’ is the mirativity marker compounded with EM3.  

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb6}
	\gll te-ŋe=seku=\textbf{laka} a-nïgï u-feke=lefa\\
	  eat.flesh-TRNS=MIR=EM3 EQS-PFV 1-ERG=SEQ\\
	\trans ‘I don’t think I was already told not to eat flesh!’ (said by Tufule at Aifa,1982)
\end{exe}

%(4) 
\subsubsection{\textit{ma} EM4}
Used as a clitic, this dubitative form references the speaker’s uncertainty due to lack of knowledge.  It is used mainly, but not exclusively, with interrogative forms. It may also serve as an epistemic neutral marker (see also conversational examples (\ref{ex:eb20})--(\ref{ex:eb23}), (\ref{ex:eb24})--(\ref{ex:eb26}), (\ref{ex:eb45c}), (\ref{ex:eb49c}), (\ref{ex:eb55c})). In the example, a narrator questions how someone in his story could put a large fish inside a small flute:

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb7}
	\gll ta-me=\textbf{ma} kuluta atati tu-i-ŋalï i-feke\\
	CONT-FACS=EM4 flute inside REF-put-REV 3-ERG\\
	\trans ‘How could he have put it back inside something like that flute?’ (said by Kambe at Aifa 1979)
\end{exe}

%(5) 
\subsubsection{\textit{maŋa} EM5} 
The speaker, while enunciating a proposition, at the same time denies any possibility of its occurrence; this form is used to express incredulity, often with the rhetorical (y/n) question prefix \textbf{\textit{tï}}. (‘I can’t believe you’re asking/saying (X) as you and I both well know the answer’.)

%a. 
The envious Trickster declares he will make the same kinds of rare and beautiful things given to his younger brother.


\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb8}
	\gll \textbf{u:um} tï-kïtsï=\textbf{maŋa} t-iŋuG-isi Taugi ki-lï\\

	\trans ‘Who thinks this is hard for me to make?/ I can only make it badly?” (=”This \textbf{is} easy for me to make”), Taugi spoke.’ (said by Tufule at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}

%b. 	
A leader’s ritual communication is often filled with this kind of ironic restraint, a kind of respectful devaluation of the work of his own messengers.  There is a feeling of the speaker’s modesty enacted by his disclaimer. 


\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb9}
	\gll tï-kaïŋa-fïŋï=\textbf{maŋa} Ø-atsa-ki-lï a-tehe=gele-fa \textbf{wãke}\\
	RQ-DEST-resemble=EM5 3-run-TRNS-PNCT EQS-PER=still-TOP EM1\\
	\trans ‘Who thinks they still don’t run up to some place as they had done in the past? (Leader’s talk, spoken by Ageu at Aifa, 1998)
\end{exe}

%(6) 
\subsubsection{kaɳa EM6} 
The speaker expresses the unlikeliness of an event. 

%a.  
An event has taken place,  and the speaker had mistakenly counted on a third person (his father-in-law)  to act in a certain way.  Line (\ref{ex:eb11}) has the EM11 from Set C which marks polite regret to the listener for his agreeing to let his father-in-law do so.

\begin{exe}
	\ex
	\begin{xlist}
	\ex \label{ex:eb10}
	\gll ige-tomi=\textbf{kaŋa}-fa igei\\
	take.away-PURP=EM6-TOP IDEM\\
	\trans ‘Although it was unlikely  I would be escorted/led for that’,
	\ex \label{ex:eb11}
	\gll ukw-oto-feke=\textbf{kiŋi} a-tïfïgï-ko ige-tomi.\\
	dual-relative-ERG= EM11 EQS-IMP-PL take.away-PURP\\
	\trans ‘regrettably  I \textbf{let} our relative (parent) be our escort/ leader’. (said by Kambe at Aifa, 1980)
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%b.         
Here the speaker uses EM6 to taunt an enemy to begin shooting at him. He asserts he it’s not likely he can rely on the interlocutor to bring him some arrows.  The speaker uses the \textit{ki}-applicative to change the verb ‘go’ from an  intransitive to a transitive ‘go to do X’ with the complement verb‘ bring’ .

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb12}
	\gll uege=\textbf{kaŋa} te-ta-tiga u-fïgi ï-ki.\\
	you=EM6 go.to-CONT-HAB 1-arrow bring-IMP\\
	\trans  'I can \textbf{hardly count on you} to always go to bring my arrows to me (=i.e., ‘shoot me’).' (said by Kudyu at Aifa, 1980)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Set B}

Information is marked as ‘external’ to the speaker’s experience or not foregrounded. There are four members of this set. As with A, there is an assumption about the interlocutor’s thoughts, wishes, or plans, but not any direct hearsay evidence. 

%(7) 
\subsubsection{\textit{nika} EM7}
The marker is a kind of strong supposition of the speaker’s regarding the interlocutor’s experience or wish.  It is often a strong marker of mourning (see example \ref{ex:eb17}).

%      a.    
A husband is anxiously looking for his wives and comes to a place where he expects to find them. He politely suggests to some other women that they have seen his wives there:

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb13}
	\gll aŋi=\textbf{nika} inde u-oku-ŋi-ta i-ŋi-lï e-feke-ne\\
	result=EM7 here 1-liquid.food-TRNS-CONT 3-see-PNCT 2-ERG-PL\\
	\trans ‘You \textbf{might have} seen those who make my food around here.’ (said by Tufule at Aifa, 1978)
\end{exe}

% b.  
Compounded clitics: regarding speaker’s denying asserted knowledge with interlocutor:

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb14}
	\gll afïtï=\textbf{nika}=wãke e-ndisï-fuŋu=\textbf{wãke}, ti-ŋiŋi-lï-i \textbf{wãke}.\\

	\trans ‘How could we have known if that was the daughter (\textbf{about whom you wished for}) \textbf{we saw before}?' (said by Ugaki at Aifa, 1982)
\end{exe}

	\trans '''The fact is my son wants to die later, \textbf{doesn’t he},”  his mother began to say.' (said by Kudyu at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}

%(8)  
\subsubsection{\textit{tata} EM8}
There is possibility but some uncertainty as the epistemic object involved a 3$^{rd}$ person, or a distant past source of information, and therefore the speaker could not know for certain that the event took place. However,  some probability from inferential or customary experience exists.  

\begin{exe}

%(10). 
\subsubsection{koh EM10}  
The speaker has no knowledge of what is being described. This morpheme is most often a particle. and is also used to begin a sentence as an expressive (example \ref{ex:eb25}). The scope of \textit{koh} covers the utterance which it follows.
  
%a. 	
A husband returns and begins to burn a pile of brush in which, unknowingly,  his wife’s lover is hiding. When the man runs away to escape the fire, the husband wonders why his wife never told him.

\section{Discussion of Sets C (Contraspective), and D (Counter-expectation)}\label{s:eb3}

\subsection{Set C}
Contraspective: in the sense there is a imaginative wishing or hoping  (sometimes, in vain) for a difference in what has been told to, or what is being observed by, the speaker. 

%(11) 
\subsubsection{\textit{kiŋi}; \textit{kiŋi-ni} (plural) EM11} 
This is used to mark regret for what has been told to the speaker. This contraspective marker is a negative nominalization of the verb \textit{ki} ‘utter’. The following example also appears in (\ref{ex:eb11}); the speaker regrets having participated in a joint venture.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb27}
	\gll uk$^w$-oto-feke=\textbf{kiŋi} a-tïfïgï-ko ige-tomi.\\

	\trans 'I regret I let our relative (parent) be our escort.' (said by Kambe at Aifa, 1980)
\end{exe}

%b. 
As in this example EM11 often appears hosted by the agreement expression \textit{eh he} whereby a speaker acknowledges affirmatively what the interlocutor has said but is expressing regret. (other examples include \ref{ex:eb50d}; \ref{ex:eb51b}; 25aii-iii?) %TODO probably example (\ref{ex:eb63b})--(\ref{ex:eb63c})

	agreement EM11, agreement\\
	\trans ‘If only it weren’t so, all right’. (said by Tufule at Aifa 1979)
\end{exe}

%(12) 
\subsubsection{\textit{muk$^w$e} EM12} 
This marks the restrained or suppressed character of the utterance, an indication of the  speaker politely expressing a positive wish or expectation.  There can also be a realization on the speaker’s part that the proposition may be in vain.  This is a frequent marker in narratives; see also the conversational examples (\ref{ex:eb40b}), (\ref{ex:eb48b}), (25a,i, ii,iii?), (\ref{ex:eb70b}). %TODO probably example ( \ref{ex:eb63a})--(\ref{ex:eb63c})

	\trans ‘If only he were human he might  be my husband.’ (said by Ugaki at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}

%b.
This example shows the speaker’s  use of \textbf{\textit{muk$^w$e}} to mark his restraint and modesty as a son-in-law proposing a work party to help the family. (The full conversational context appears as examples \ref{ex:eb40}--\ref{ex:eb41}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb32}

	\trans 'This way hopefully we’ll make some flavoring for our fesoko fish.'
\end{exe}

\subsection{Set D}

\emph{Counter-expectation or reevaluation of evidence} with regard to the receipt of new information.  The speaker corrects or denies their own proposition.  There are three markers.

%(13) 
\subsubsection{\textit{maki} EM13} 
The speaker reevaluates what s(he) knows.  New (introspective) information results in reevaluation of speaker’s own earlier proposition.  In (\ref{ex:eb33}): the adverb \textit{ande} is a deictic feature. To know there is a prior proposition comes from  the context of the narrative in which the speaker claims to have to travel in another direction which the interlocutor says won’t take him to the river.

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb33}
	\gll ande=\textbf{maki} fanguiŋga=lefa, nïgifeke.\\
	here.now=EM13 river=SEQ, QUOT\\
	\trans ‘Ok, now I see that the river is here after all”, he said to (him)’. (said by Kambe at Aifa, 1982)
\end{exe}

In (\ref{ex:eb34}), the speaker, who had thought to be a member of the Trumai group, now realizes he has been abducted as a child and says: 

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb34}
	\gll afïtï=\textbf{maki} Tugumai-fuŋu ku-kuge\\
	denial=EM13 Trumai-resemble 1+2-people\\
	\trans ‘not I realize we people resemble Trumai’, i.e., ‘I realize we people are are not Trumai’. (said by Ausuki at Aifa 1982)
\end{exe}

% (14)  
\subsubsection{\textit{makina} EM14} New (introspective ) information leads to acceptance of the interlocutor’s earlier proposition which was rejected: 

%a.     
A man has killed his mother-in-law but has told his wife that the woman has died from a fish on which she choked to death.  The narrator begins this part of his story with a description of what the wife sees (her first-hand evidence (\ref{ex:eb35a}--\ref{ex:eb35b})), which is followed by the woman’s surprised reaction to this evidence:  her  use of the \textbf{\textit{ah}} expressive to assert her understanding of the truth of the event, followed by her acceptance of the husband-listener’s deception,  using EM17 and the mirative \textit{ki}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:eb35}

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\end{exe}


%(15) 
\subsubsection{\textit{pile} EM15}  The speaker moves from acceptance to rejection of a proposition.

%a. 
A young man has agreed throughout the narrative to go to dangerous places to get things  for his brother (whose wife is his lover), but finally realizes the brother is trying to kill him. 

\begin{exe}

	\trans ‘\textbf{I mistakenly thought} my pubic ornament would be here.’ (said by Kambe at Aifa, 1979)
\end{exe}


\section{Discussion of Sets E and F}\label{s:eb4}

\textbf{Sets E} (five examples) and \textbf{F} (eight examples) concern the speaker’s marking of epistemic alignment, that is,  confirmation of a shared (or in two cases, disputed) proposition.  These sets are probably large because they are used when there is a speaker’s need to shift between a focus upon the epistemic object; the marking of a unique or shared perspective ; and the marking of the interpersonal alignment,  that is, participation with the interlocutor in an epistemic context involving a joint venture.  As is often the case, such contexts themselves change throughout  a conversation and there is often ‘disclaimed’ responsibility in which EM play a significant role.  My examples include a number of examples of dialogic contexts that illustrate the  co-construction of epistemic and evidential meaning.  Examples of markers from sets A-D appear in these longer examples. Speakers in these examples discuss issues of responsibility, denial of conjoint participation in a pragmatic context, and engagement in deception while using the affinal civility register (\citealt{Basso2007}).

\subsection{Set E}

Markers in this set concern shared information and reference the interlocutors participating in a joint venture; one negative marks refusal to share information. Conjunct/disjunct contrasts occur and degrees of knowledge are also marked.

%16.
\subsubsection{\textit{tafa} EM16} 
The speaker asserts their own (or a 1$^{st}$ person plural) alignment with the listener. The example shows both the speaker and interloctor’s use of the ‘distant future’ FUT.2, %TODO glossing 
as a reciprocal pragmatic politeness marker (see \citealt{Mendoza2016} on use of future as a politeness strategy). 

%a.. 
Cuckoo’s mother tells him to come home right away from his uncle’s settlement if the man’s  daughter he wishes to marry decides she doesn’t want him after all. Cuckoo’s answer is in Line (\ref{ex:eb39b}).

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%17. 
\subsubsection{\textit{kafa} (EM17)} 
A logophoric marker, \textbf{\textit{kafa}} indicates the speaker’s presumption of a 3$^{rd}$ person’s wants,  feeling, or experience.   In this narrative section from the same story as (\ref{ex:eb36a}), four epistemic markers appear.  The speaker  affirms the 3$^{rd}$ person has accepted their proposition and asks his wife to accept a trip to get salt, which he apparently wants to do to benefit the family.  The noun ‘our parent’ used for ‘parent-in-law’ and \textbf{\textit{muk$^w$e}} EM12 are especially typical of the affinal civility register he is using, and the markers of politeness clearly enable what turns out to be his terribly deceptive speech. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:eb40}
	\begin{xlist}
	\ex  use of ‘our parent’ as politeness marker \label{ex:eb40a}\\

	\gll {eh he} nïgifeke\\
	greement QUOT\\
	\trans '“All right” she said.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In line (\ref{ex:eb41a}), the speaker uses compounded markers EM22 \textbf{\textit{taka}} for suggestion of a 2p %TODO glossing?
prior agreement and \textbf{\textit{nafa}} logophorically for marking the third person;  the speaker also uses the  EM2 \textbf{\textit{tifa}} to affirm her need or wish.  
Of interest is the narrator’s final comment about how even though he is lying to his wife,  the speaker is able to convince her by using these epistemic markers that he should take his mother-in-law to the salt plants. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:eb41}

	\trans ‘He was deceiving her.’ (said by Kudyu at Aifa 1979)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


%18.
\subsubsection{\textit{kato} (EM18)}  
Another marker with logophoric uses, a strategy for gossipy speech as the speaker is sharing worrisome information regarding a 3$^{rd}$ person with  an interlocutor,  and denies any responsibility for what is being said. The speaker confirms what the 3$^{rd}$  person has said,  but does not always accept it as legitimate.  As the speaker aligns in this manner with the 3$^{rd}$ person outside the present speech context the shared proposition is puzzling, or even worrisome. 

%a. 
From the Kwambï,  a ritual song during which gossip about the singer is ‘thrown back’ at the original speakers:

	\trans 
\end{exe}

%b.   
People are trying to kill jaguars. They come to a community to see if some youths can be prepared as warriors. The boys are tested by killing a tapir:  In Line (\ref{ex:eb43a}) the speaker uses the third person logophiric \textbf{\textit{kafa}} because the childen’s actions confirms their proposal of a joint venture.  In Line \ref{ex:eb43b}, there is use of \textbf{\textit{kato}}. Here the proposal that the children might be able to kill the jaguars is considered possible by the speaker but still somewhat weak and worrisome, which is given further context by the narrator’s explanatory material in Line \ref{ex:eb43c}.

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%19. 
\subsubsection{\textit{tiki} EM19} This marks the speaker’s refusal to accept a role in an endeavor described by the interlocutor or by third persons.  \textbf{\textit{tiki}} is also a mirative form that emphasizes the speaker’s sudden surprise concerning the contrastive understanding or disagreement.  The form may be derived from the negative mirative suffix –\textbf{\textit{ki}} (see also example \ref{ex:eb49f}--\ref{ex:eb49g} with \textit{tifa}). 

%a. 
A woman has been abducted by powerful beings and left in her hammock tied to a tree in the wilderness.  When she wakes up, she says:

The following example describes people escaping a massacre who are giving out dead hummingbirds as food to their fellow travellers. What occurs as a consequence is a case of oracular interpretation insofar as responsibility for a problematic decision is displaced deictically away from the discourse of the 2$^{nd}$ person human locutors and onto the 3$^{rd}$ person non-human epistemic object.  In Line (\ref{ex:eb48b}), there is a use of \textbf{\textit{muk$^w$e}}  (EM12)as ‘hoping in vain’. In Line (\ref{ex:eb48c}), there is a use of \textbf{\textit{maki}} (EM13) marking change of opinion after receipt of new information (see also line iv).

In this example, an entire conversation is presented to show how EM19 emerges at the end of presentation of knowledge by the interlocutors.  This is when the speaker expresses surprise and also questions knowledge.

\subsection{Set F}

This set marks differences between the speaker and listener regarding a speaker’s agreement to participate in the proposal of a shared context for information.   The speaker appeals to a listener with a marked grade of confidence,  referencing the conjoint situation.  There is a contrast between these and EM19, which marks the speaker’s denial of any conjoint agreement.

%21 
\subsubsection{\textit{aka} EM21} The speaker substantiates the interlocutor’s  proposition and information is shared by the speaker with the listener.  The speaker declares there is existing, positive alignment between herself (often as a member of a non-inclusive plural group) and the listener.  In example (\ref{ex:eb50a}), the speaker uses \textbf{\textit{nika}} (EM7 Set B) to align with the interloctor’s experience.
In Line (\label{ex:eb50d}), he uses \textit{eh he \textbf{kiŋi}}, regretful agreement.

%22. 
\subsubsection{\textit{taka} EM22} 
This is a weak or uncertain conjunct marker. With this marker,  the speaker proposes to the listener (s)he will probably agree with the proposition but speaks somewhat uncertainly.  In my examples, =\textbf{\textit{taka}} is seen with somewhat hesitant, rather than assertive speech, as there is no direct evidence the listener can use to assert knowledge or accept the proposition.

What follows is a conversational example regarding responsibility,  with examples of several different logophoric markers.  After travelling from place to place without finding her, the relatives searching for a woman have arrived in a community where some warriors (during the time of her abduction) had seen people on the river.  They have evidence but never knew how to interpret it until they are told several years later about this woman who has been abducted.  Their interlocutor uses \textbf{\textit{muk$^w$e}} as a politeness strategy.  In Line (\ref{ex:eb55b}), \textbf{\textit{kafa}} marks the speaker’s weak presumption of the third person’s experience.  In Line (\ref{ex:eb55e}), \textbf{\textit{nika}} is the second person logophoric marker emphasizing the speech of the visitor and \textbf{\textit{wãke}}  marks the speaker’s first hand, distant past experience used to assert his knowledge to the listener.What has happened is the warriors realize they didn’t have any way of knowing the people they saw on the river were the woman and her abductor.  If so,  they might have been able to release her. The narrator describes the following conversation:

\subsubsection{kalaka EM23} 
EM23 marks the speaker’s impressions of a vague 3$^{rd}$ person reflexivity.  The impressons are positive although the speaker may have no direct evidence regarding the 3$^{rd}$ person’s thoughts or even the identity of the person.  This contrasts with \textbf{\textit{kato}} (EM18), which marks worrisome impressions of a hearsay or gossipy nature on the part of the speaker.  Irrealis features in the examples contribute in several ways to the idea that \textbf{\textit{kalaka}}  marks an uncertainty ( because it introduces the clause marked with \textbf{\textit{koh}} EM10),  and even a polite proposition (because the clause is used with the -\textit{iŋo} FUT.2 distant future). %TODO glossing

%a.    
A woman suggests to her sisters that a new fruit might be used as a drink if the Trickster invents it. The use of the irrealis distant future FUT.2 contributes to this weak proposition. %TODO glossing

In this example,  the speaker suggests his mother-in-law (whom he can’t address directly)  might have an opinion different from his own.  In Line (\ref{ex:eb58b}) he uses \textbf{\textit{aka}} marking information shared with his wife.

%24. 
\subsubsection{\textit{nipa} EM24}  
Marks a contradiction  involving an interlocutor’s or 3$^{rd}$ person’s role treated as different from what has been experienced, said, or seen. \textbf{\textit{nipa}}  is often used in examples that reference the distant past,  but where the speaker has some historical evidence of positive impressions of 3$^{rd}$ persons.  For example in (\ref{ex:eb59}) the narrator’s  use of \textbf{\textit{nipa}} references impressions of temporally distant others, no longer present but mentioned in historical narratives. 

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}

%b.  
Here the complement verb, ‘see, think’ in imperative mood (\textit{iŋ-ge}), is used with the main  verb for ‘kill’.  A warrior is addressing his relative, a person with little experience:

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}

%c.   
In the context of a dispute about traveling, foreign visitors keep insisting upon going in a certain direction, even though others repeatedly show them (using arm motion)  the direction to travel so as to avoid enemies. Possibly \textbf{\textit{nipa}} is used as the participants are foreigners with no knowledge of the local geography.

\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

%25. 
\subsubsection{\textit{nifa} EM25} 
The speaker invites interlocutor into a context to share knowledge, or asserts a conjoint decision regarding 2$^nd$ person or 3$^rd$ person  (see also example (\ref{ex:eb51a}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex \label{ex:eb62}

\end{exe}

%b. 
The following example is a discussion of the need for a conjoint decision despite an oracular message to the contrary. In line (\ref{ex:eb63b}) the speaker uses \textbf{\textit{kiŋi}} (contraspective negation); and \textbf{\textit{aka}} (confirmation of 2person).  A father is asked to help prepare his young son  to be a warrior who will kill ravaging jaguars.  Unlike the earlier examples (\ref{ex:eb46})--(\label{ex:eb49}) in which the oracular message is accepted, in this case it is at first rejected but as the need to act is far more important  \textbf{\textit{nifa}} is used (Line \ref{ex:eb63c}) together with the politeness  \textbf{\textit{muk$^w$e}} ‘hope in vain’ as the speaker, a leader,  is requesting something very special of the interlocutor that will benefit the community as a whole.

%26.  papa EM26. This marker is used when the speaker agrees the interlocutor should cooperate by joining in a proposed activity.  Use of papa seems also to be a politeness strategy in speech about affinal relatives,   as seen in both .examples   
%a. The following conjoint example involves a mother agreeing to participate in her dauughter’s  new relationship of marriage, as seen by the pair’s reciprocal use of the affinal civility register in which special politeness kin terms (daughter referring to her husband as ‘your nephew’ and her mother referring to her son-in-law as ‘your younger brother’  are used.

\section{Final Observations}\label{s:eb5}

These many examples show how the several rich grammaticalized epistemic subsystems in the language may only be revealed in full through a discourse-centered approach that examines the natural contexts in which these occur.  A researcher depending primarily on elicitation or ordinary conversation might miss many of them altogether, as I discovered over time,  particularly as EM so often occur during socially discordant speech events that speakers are reluctant to invent for the foreign listener. 
Narrative and ritual speech frameworks include marking of changes in the intersubjective relation when new information is received; positive acceptance of a conjoint activity is requested by the interlocutor; and when acceptance or outright rejection of the interlocutor’s proposition occurs.  In a conversational context, there are a variety of graded ways these can be marked, from strong assertion to a weak, inferential marking and denial or disjoint marking.  Politeness or impoliteness occurs in many examples, particularly where the epistemic markers are used to mark judgments regarding conjoint activities.   With regard to a third person, the marker used depends on whether the speaker is making an inference of the third person’s stance based on common or historical memory (the logophroic \textit{kalaka} versus \textit{nipa}), as well as a stance marking based on conventional sociocultural knowledge regarding the behavior of a non-human actor (marked by \textit{nafa}).  
\cite{NuckollsLev2012}  note the importance of understanding sociocultural factors connected to the emergence of this complex type of linguistic feature.   Kalapalo EM occur in ordinary conversation, greetings, affinal civility (a register involving constrained speech and gestural modesty)  disagreement and even impolite description of a proposition ,  and most notably in quoted conversations that form important segments of extended narrative discourse.  EM contribute pragmatically in these contexts to the ‘unity and the experience of stance as it emerges in dialogic interaction’ (\citealt[35]{DuBois2007}), and there may be more person-to-person temporal and evidential features involved.  EM show types of distribution of responsibility, including requested or agreed-upon  alignment involving participation in an epistemic context,  as well as a speaker’s denial or rejection of co-participation, and denial of alleged responsibility.  Quoted speech in narrative discourse exemplifies a speaker’s need to shift between a focus on the epistemic object; marking of unique or shared perspectives, and reference to the interpersonal participation in epistemically situated discourses (which may also include deliberate impoliteness, involving the speaker’s  refusal to use the civility register as anticipated by interlocutors).  As is often the case, such contexts themselves change throughout a conversation, and there are a number of EM (especially sets C and D) that mark the nature of these person-to-person deictic shifts. This body of Kalapalo data forces us to look at interpersonal speech practice and experience,  which challenges a  simple contrast between private and public, micro- and macro-sociological events.  Memories of such dialogical production of meaning and the effect of these processes on social roles and relationships are preserved in the Kalapalo narrative materials discussed here, an important source for understanding the social and historical forces that have led to the emergence of this complex set of epistemic markers.
